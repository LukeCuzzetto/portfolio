        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey, my name is Luke Cuzzetto, a recent graduate from Thompson Rivers University here in Kamloops, British Columbia. I graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science in December 2024 and have now moved onto getting into the Game Developemnt industry. 
            Being a recent graduate, I am super excited to start my career as a Game Developer.
        I am proficient with Unity, Unreal Engine 5, Godot and Blender, as well as a multitude of Programming Languages, such as C++, C#, Python, Java, MySQL, PHP and Javascript.</p>
        <p>From the time I was 10 I was playing games on my families computer in the living room, taking up all the time that I could to get better then my siblings, while getting fully immersed in the games I was playing.
            Doing so formed a love for games and the industry that I have never lost growing up. 
            Being so interested in games for so long, I decided to go to University to learn how to make them myself. I have been learning and growing and I am excited to see where my career takes me and what I can accomplish in the future.</p>

                <h3>Aim Trainer</h3>
                <p>This is the first Game Development project I did. Being heavily addicted to Counter Strike for many years, I thought "Why not make something I can use to make me better?", so I created this simple Aim Trainer for me to use. </p>
                <p>This simple game had a "start" button (the orange stick) that the player would interact with that would start a timed trial, which would then go for a set amount of time and count the number of targets hit during that time. Once finished, it would reset and the player would go again.</p>
            <p>This introduced me to the basic controls and programming practices inside Unity's engine, such as Aiming, 3D Movement, Particle Systems, Raycasts, Instantiating objects and Audio Sources. </p>

                <h3>Colossal Brew</h3>
                <p>This project was started during an IEEE Game Development Seminar in the summer of 2024, in hopes of being submitted to the Pirate Games Gamejam.</p>
                <p>This was a 2D project done in Godot. I was in a team of 4, with 2 other students and a Professor from my University acting as our Lore creator. This 2D platformer took place on moving "colossi" that the player would have to climb. These acted as the levels for the player. Inside these levels the player would find enemies and items to collect and bring back to their Home Base.</p>
                <p>I worked on implementing core mechanics, such as combat and movement to the game, as well as helped create the initial Game Loops and Game Pillars for the game.</p>
